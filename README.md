# dj-react

In this project I used react to make a DJ soundboard with buttons that change colors of the boxes rendered at the top.

With this project I am practicing and learning the ins-and-outs of react, and learning to think like a react developer by passing props around, piecing together components, and writing logic that links it all together and makes my app work as intended.
